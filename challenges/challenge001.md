# Stake Wars Challenge 001
Published on: May 25th 2020

Create your BetaNet wallet, deploy your node, and correctly configure your staking pool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Generate your wallet
2. Deploy your NEAR node
3. Configure your Staking Pool
4. Apply to join Stake Wars

## 1.Generate your wallet

You have to install [near-shell](https://github.com/near/near-shell), a Node.js application that relies on nearlib to generate secure keys, connect to the NEAR platform and send transactions to the network on your behalf.
You don't have to install near-shell on your validator node - on the contrary, it's suggested to keep your staking wallet on a different machine.

1. Create and `cd` a directory you'd like to work in, such as `mkdir stakewars && cd stakewars`
2. Download `near-shell` with `npm install -g near-shell`
3. Set your NODE_ENV to betanet. You can do this in `bash` with the command `export NODE_ENV=betanet`
4. Run `near login` and follow the instructions that take you to the wallet

Please be sure to have Node 10+ installed before trying to run near shell

## 2.Deploy your NEAR node
