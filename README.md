# May 19th 2020 update: Stake Wars Episode II, Return of the Validators

Welcome to NEAR's Stake Wars Episode II, Return of the Validators!

This page will guide you through the three main aspects of this initiative:
1. What is NEAR's Stake Wars
2. Your toolbox
3. What you have to do

## What is NEAR Stake Wars

Stake Wars is the incentivized testnet program designed for the professional validators who want to join NEAR's MainNet.

NEAR’s [MainNet](https://explorer.near.org/) recently launched into its first phase, called “POA” ([see full roadmap](https://near.ai/mainnet-roadmap)). This means that a small handful of validating nodes are currently being run by the core team. In order to progress to the next phase, “MainNet: Restricted”, the operation of the network will be handed off to a large group of node operators called validators. 

The goal of Stake Wars: Episode II is to onboard those validators, test the stability of the system on BetaNet/TestNet, and begin introducing some of the unique aspects of NEAR’s delegation in preparation for the next phase of MainNet itself.

If you want to know more about the initiative, read the [Stake Wars Episode II blog post](https://near.org/blog/stake-wars-episode-ii/).

**TL;DR:**
Stake Wars Ep.II introduces NEAR's contract-based delegation, enabling validators to interoperate with [Open Finance](https://near.org/blog/the-evolution-of-the-open-web/). There is a _staking pool_ reference contract on [Github](https://github.com/near/initial-contracts), ready for validators who want to experiment with these principles. Deploying the staking pool and participating in the Stake Wars will give access to NEAR's MainNet Restricted. Rewards will include 10,000 NEAR tokens/month for every validator on MainNet Restricted, plus 1 Million NEAR tokens for contributions and community challenges. Judgment criteria will be quantitative, such as number of blocks generated and uptime; and qualitative, such as reactivity to network updates and community participation.
A Validator Advisory Board, with a selected group of professional validators, will become over time the voice of validators in the technical governance of the protocol

## Your Toolbox

From code waiting to be compiled, to the theory behind the protocol, you have multiple levels of interaction with NEAR Protocol.

### Github Repositories
NEAR is using two main accounts: [github.com/nearprotocol](https://github.com/nearprotocol) and [github.com/near](https://github.com/near).
The repositories that you, as a validator, will use the most are:
- [nearcore](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore), the reference client for NEAR Protocol
- [nearup](https://github.com/near/nearup), public scripts to launch NEAR Protocol devnet, betanet and testnet nodes
- [near-shell](https://github.com/near/near-shell), the general purpose command line tools for interacting with NEAR Protocol
- [initial-contracts](https://github.com/near/initial-contracts), which include the _staking pool_ 

### NEAR Documentation
Most of the technical documentation is available at [docs.near.org](https://docs.near.org). An entire section is dedicated to validators.
If you really want to know more about the protocol itself, don't miss these papers:
- [NEAR Whitepaper](https://nearprotocol.com/papers/the-official-near-white-paper).
- [Economics in Sharded Blockchain](https://nearprotocol.com/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/).
- [Sharding Design: Nightshade](https://nearprotocol.com/papers/nightshade).

### NEAR Website and Blog
NEAR's website [near.org](https://near.org) provides also a block explorer, a web wallet and some app examples:
- NEAR Protocol BetaNet explorer: [explorer.betanet.near.org](https://explorer.betanet.near.org/)
- NEAR BetaNet web wallet: [wallet.betanet.near.org](https://wallet.betanet.near.org)
- NEAR app examples: [near.dev](https://near.dev)
